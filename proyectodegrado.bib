abstract = {Ensuring minimum rights and safety of the garment workers has become a burning issue nowadays. The workers of garment factories are facing some labyrinths and broken out of fire is surely one of them. The investors are losing their interest and the prominence of this sector is getting toneless. In this paper, we have propounded a system which is capable to detect fire and can provide the location of the affected region. Raspberry Pi 3 has been used to control multiple Arduino which are integrated with a couple of sensors and camera. A 360 relay motor is assembled with the camera so that it can snap the image in whatever angle the fire is detected. We have provided a confirmation of the fire suspecting system to avoid any false alarm. The system will immediately send a message along with the image of the affected spot and Arduino's location. An admin can confirm or deny the impeachment and if the admin confirms the situation as a breaking out of fire, then the system will immediately raise an alarm and an automatic message will be sent to the nearby fire brigade.},

abstract = {? 2016 IEEE.This paper presents the development of a firmware for a Smart Switch, which can control the on-off of any electrical device at home by using internet. The Smart Switch is connected to internet via Wi-FiTM, through a computer, smartphone, tablet or any device with internet access. In order to perform this connection it is necessary to write the IP pre-programmed into the Smart Switch in a web browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) with the purpose to load the Smart Switch server, which will open a configuration page to write the data of the users network. Then, the user will select in automatic mode the network, the security type, and the user must have written a passphrase. Once these information is uploaded and saved, it is necessary to restart the Smart Switch in order to get access to internet, from which the user can control the Smart Switch simply sending a number one or a number zero to switch the electrical device, this process is done in principle via the internet, but it can be done without the use of internet, i.e. by using a local network.},

@article{Babovic2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. An area of intensive research under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in intensive proliferation of globally deployed sensor devices that provide a basis for the development of different use-case applications working with real-time data and demanding a rich user interface. Overcoming the lack of the standard HTML platform, HTML5 specifications WebSocket and Canvas graphics strongly supported the development of rich real-time applications. Such support has been offered by browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight for years. In order to provide a deep insight into IoT Web application performance, we implemented two test applications. In the first application, we measured latencies induced by different communication protocols and message encodings, as well as graphics rendering performance, while comparing the performance of different Web platform implementations. In the second application, we compared Web performance of IoT messaging protocols such as MQTT, AMQP, XMPP, and DDS by measuring the latency of sensor data message delivery and the message throughput rate. Our tests have shown that although Adobe Flash has the best performance at the moment, HTML5 platform is also very capable of running real-time IoT Web applications, whereas Microsoft Silverlight is noticeably behind both platforms. On the other hand, MQTT is the most appropriate messaging protocol for a wide set of IoT Web applications. However, IoT application developers should be aware of certain MQTT message broker implementation shortcomings that could prevent the usage of this protocol.},
